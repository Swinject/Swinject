 This class is used to registered types where the initializer is controlled by some third party framework
 (i.e. UIViewController, UIView)

 --- Example ---
 ```
 // Object Being Resolved
 class MyViewController: UIViewController {
     var myObject: MyObject!

     init(withCoder coder: Coder) {
         super.init(coder: coder)
         ManualResolver.finishConstruction(me: self)
     }

     init(withNibNameOrNil nibNameOrNil: Coder) {
         super.init(nibNameOrNil: nibNameOrNil)
         ManualResolver.finishConstruction(me: self)
     }

     func inject(myObject: MyObject) {
         self.myObject = myObject
     }
 }

 // Registration
 class MyAssembly: Assembly {
     func assemble(container: Container) {
         container.registerManualConstruction(MyViewController.self) { (resolver, myViewController) in
             let myObject = resolver.resolve(MyObject.self)!
             myViewController.inject(myObject)
         }
     }
 }

 // Starting the Application
 let assembler = Assembler([MyAssembly()], container: ManualResolver.container)
 assembler.resolver.resolve(RootObjectThatKicksEverythingOff.self)

     This property is used to determine if the object being resolved should be resolved, and primarily used for testing.

     During testing, to get the correct test doubles injected you might need to call the inject function manually.
     Instead of having the object injected twice and ensuring that all dependent types are registered properly,
     the ManualResolver can be turned off by setting this property to false.

                (i.e. `inObjectScope()`).
