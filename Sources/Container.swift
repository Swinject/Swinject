///
///     let container = Container()
///     container.register(A.self) { _ in B() }
///     container.register(X.self) { r in Y(a: r.resolve(A.self)!) }

///
///     let x = container.resolve(X.self)!
///
/// where `A` and `X` are protocols, `B` is a type conforming `A`, and `Y` is a type conforming `X` and depending on `A`.
