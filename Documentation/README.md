# Documentation

Swinject is a lightweight dependency injection framework for Swift apps. It allows you to split your app into loosely-coupled components, which can then be maintained and tested more easily. Swinject <a name="pure-swift-type-support">supports pure Swift types</a>, and is powered by the Swift generic type system and [first class functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function). This makes it syntactically elegant and simple to define the object dependencies for your app.
